HOW TO SET UP A SMALL INITIAL MONGODB COLLECTION

What is required? A MongoDB server version 3.4. You can download a MongoDB server at https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav#community.

You must have at least version 3.4 because the document structure uses the new NumberDecimal data format.

Once your server is set up and running, the fun begins. 

These files can be added in any order:

test_add_fizzie
test_add_garbuckle
test_add_smith

In Linux or MacOS, you can open a shell promopt and start the mongo shell.

You can add the above files using the mongo shell like this (as an example):

mongo < test_add_fizzie

This file:

test_add_second_ride_smith

...can only be added after the member Smith has been initially added to the collection.
This is because the update method is being called, not the insert method. The document 
to be updated must already exist.
