# BikeArlington Freezing Saddles

## MongoDB version of Bike Arlington Freezing Saddles Data.

This branch is in development.  It is likely to be broken.

The BikeArlington Freezing Saddles ("bafs") project is a web application that integrates with Strava APIs to 
provide charting (and intended to provide other reports too) for the Freezing Saddles cycling competition organized
on BikeArlington forums.

## Dependencies
 
* Node.js 
* Setuptools/Distribute
* Virtualenv
* [Stravalib](http://github.com/hozn/stravalib) 0.2 development version (from git)

## Installation

Eventually this will be installable via setuptools/distribute/pip; however, currently you must 
download / clone the source and run the python setup.py install command.

Here are some instructions for setting up a development environment, which is more appropriate
at this juncture.  Note that this library requires stravalib.

	# Clone both bafs and stravalib repositories
	shell$ git clone https://github.com/hozn/bafs.git
	shell$ git clone https://github.com/hozn/stravalib.git
	
	# Create and activate a virtual environment for bafs
	shell$ cd bafs
	shell$ python -m virtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute env
	shell$ source env/bin/activate
	
	# Install stravalib symlink into bafs virtual environment 
	(env) shell$ cd ../stravalib && python setup.py develop
	
	# Now download the rest of the deps for bafs
	(env) shell$ cd ../bafs && python setup.py develop

We will assume for all subsequent shell examples that you are running in the bafs activated virtualenv.  (This is denoted by using 
the "(env) shell$" prefix before shell commands.)    
   
### Database Setup

This application requires MySQL.  I know, MySQL is a horrid database, but since I have to host this myself (and my shared hosting
provider only supports MySQL), it's what we're doing.

You should create a database and create a user that can access the database.  Something like this should work in the default case:

	shell$ mysql -uroot
	mysql> create database bafs;
	mysql> grant all on bafs.* to bafs@localhost;

## Basic Usage

### Configuration

Configuration files are Python files (since we're using Flask framework).  There is a default one configured for the 2013 BAFS competition;
if you want to do something else you'll need to specify an environment variable that points to your config file:

	(env) shell$ cp local_settings.py-example local_settings.py
	(env) shell$ BAFS_SETTINGS=`pwd`/local_settings.py <bafs-script>
	
Critical things to set include:
* Database URI
* Strava Client info (ID and secret)

```python

# The SQLALchemy connection URL for your MySQL database.
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql://bafs@localhost/bafs'

# These are issued when you create the Strava app.
STRAVA_CLIENT_ID = 'xxxx1234'
STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET = '5678zzzz'
```
	
### Synchronizing

You need to pull data from Strava (and any other APIs) into the local database for reporting.

	(env) shell$ BAFS_SETTINGS=/path/to/local_settings.py bafs-sync
	
It is slow the first time because it does not parallelize the work.  By default it will only pull down rides that aren't
already in the system.  Periodically (daily?) you probably also want to clear things out and pull down everything (e.g. in
case someone edited a ride, etc.)

	(env) shell$ BAFS_SETTINGS=/path/to/local_settings.py bafs-sync --clear

### Running the (Development) Server

You can start up the Flask development server for testing using the `bafs-server` command.

	(env) shell$ BAFS_SETTINGS=/path/to/local_settings.py bafs-server
